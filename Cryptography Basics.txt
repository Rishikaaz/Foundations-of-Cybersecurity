# Cryptography Basics

## 1. Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption

### Symmetric Encryption
Concept: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
Pros: Fast and efficient for large amounts of data.
Cons: Key distribution is difficult (how to share the key securely?).
Algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard - obsolete), 3DES, RC4.
Use Case: Encrypting a hard drive, database encryption.

### Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Key Cryptography)
Concept: Uses a pair of keys: a Public Key (shared with everyone) and a Private Key (kept secret).
  Encrypt with Public Key -> Decrypt with Private Key (Confidentiality).
  Encrypt with Private Key -> Decrypt with Public Key (Digital Signature/Authentication).
Pros: Solves the key exchange problem.
Cons: Much slower than symmetric encryption.
Algorithms: RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), Diffie-Hellman (Key Exchange).
Use Case: SSL/TLS handshakes, SSH keys, Digital Signatures.

## 2. Hashing
Definition: A one-way function that converts data of any size into a fixed-size string of characters (the hash or digest). It is irreversible.
Purpose: Verifying Integrity. If one bit of the data changes, the hash changes completely (Avalanche Effect).
Common Algorithms:
  MD5: 128-bit hash. Fast but vulnerable to collision attacks. (Avoid for security).
  SHA-1: 160-bit hash. Deprecated due to vulnerabilities.
  SHA-256: 256-bit hash. Currently the industry standard (used in Bitcoin, SSL).
  SHA-3: The newest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family.

## 3. Digital Certificates & SSL/TLS
Digital Certificate: An electronic "passport" that establishes your credentials when doing business on the Web. It binds a Public Key to an Identity (Domain name, Organization).
  Issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) (e.g., Let's Encrypt, DigiCert).
SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security):
  TLS is the modern successor to SSL.
  Uses Asymmetric Encryption for the initial Handshake (exchanging keys).
  Uses Symmetric Encryption for the actual data transfer (Session).
  Uses Hashing to ensure data integrity during transit.

## 4. Hands-on: Encrypt and Decrypt with OpenSSL

### Symmetric Encryption (AES-256)
1. Create a file:
   `echo "This is a secret message" > secret.txt`
2. Encrypt the file:
   `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in secret.txt -out secret.enc`
3. Decrypt the file:
   `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in secret.enc -out decrypted.txt`
4. Verify:
   `cat decrypted.txt`

### Hashing
1. Generate SHA-256 hash:
   `openssl dgst -sha256 secret.txt`
2. Modify the file and check hash change:
   `echo " modification" >> secret.txt`
   `openssl dgst -sha256 secret.txt`
